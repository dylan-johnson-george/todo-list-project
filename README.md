# todo-list-project

This project is a todo-list app written in React for the front-end with most of the styling created with bootstrap.
The back-end is a Node/Express server with a MongoDB database.
Authentication is dealt with by Google Oauth 2.0.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


To start the project locally, in the root, you can run: 

### `npm run dev`

Then open a new terminal tab and run: 

### `cd client`
### `npm run dev`

This will start both the front and back end in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
